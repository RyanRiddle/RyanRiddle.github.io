<title>Six Weeks at the Recurse Center</title>

<h1>Six Weeks at the Recurse Center</h1>

<p>Today I started my seventh week at the Recurse Center.  Before I dive in to my seventh week, I want to review the first sixth weeks.  This is a list of things I have worked on.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I got really <a href="high-five.html">enthusiastic</a> about optimizing my solution to a programming exercise.</li>
  <li>I started writing a persistent database in Ruby.</li>
  <li>I learned about and <a href="ruby-db.html">used</a> Ruby Generators to query my persistent database</li>
  <li>I did performance benchmarking on my database!</li>
  <li>I implemented a <a href="btree.html">B-Tree</a>.</li>
  <li>I learned about methods for laying out records on disk.</li>
  <li>I learned about Log Structured Merge Trees (LevelDB uses these).</li>
  <li>I learned about rollback journals and write-ahead logs and how they are used in transactional databases.</li>
  <li>I wrote a program that uses C++17's std::optional</li>
  <li>I grokked backtracking!  And I used it to solve some programming problems like the 8 queens puzzle</li>
  <li>I wrote a program to find a fast path to visit every stop in the NYC <a href="subway.html">subway</a></li>
  <li>I started learning Haskell!</li>
  <li>I wrote a <a href="haskell-huffman.html">Huffman Encoding program</a> in Haskell.</li>
  <li>I wrote a JSON library in Haskell and then wrote the same library in C++.</li>
  <li>I read chapter 2.3 in Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs.</li>
  <li>I paired on a <a href="https://github.com/RyanRiddle/purple-haze">Firefox add-on</a></li>
  <li>I code reviewed another recurser's tetris program</li>
  <li>I helped another recurser debug her C++ program.</li>
</ul>
